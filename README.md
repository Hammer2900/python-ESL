# python-ESL

This is FreeSWITCH's ESL library and SWIG, pulled directly out of
tree. Nothing more, nothing less, no modifications.

All we've done is replaced the Makefile with setuptools to make it pip
installable.

    pip install git+https://github.com/sangoma/python-ESL

Should work for both python2 and python3.
